but other API maybe used after API fetch methods and url endpoints are updated accordingly.

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iKreateCode/FoodRocket.git
cd FoodRocket
```

2. Open Android Studio (terminal or GUI can be used)
